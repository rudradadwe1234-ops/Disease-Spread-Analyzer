# Disease Spread Analyzer

## Overview

The Disease Spread Analyzer is a data analysis project designed to study disease spread patterns using a large synthetically generated dataset. The project focuses on understanding how demographic, environmental, and healthcare-related factors influence disease risk levels and regional hotspots.

This project is intended for academic and learning purposes and demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and basic risk modeling techniques using Python.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze disease spread trends using synthetic data  
- Examine the impact of population density, mobility, vaccination rates, and healthcare infrastructure  
- Classify disease risk into Low, Medium, and High categories  
- Identify regional disease hotspots  
- Visualize relationships between key health and environmental indicators  

---

## Features

- Synthetic dataset with over 5,000 records  
- Multiple health, environmental, and infrastructure-related attributes  
- Risk score calculation based on selected indicators  
- Risk level classification:
  - Low Risk  
  - Medium Risk  
  - High Risk  
- Regional hotspot analysis  
- Clear and informative visualizations

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Gradio

## Dataset Description

The dataset is generated programmatically within the project and includes the following attributes:

- Population Density  
- Infection Rate  
- Recovery Rate  
- Death Rate  
- Vaccination Rate  
- Mobility Index  
- Air Quality Index  
- Average Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Hospital Beds per 1,000 People  
- ICU Capacity  
- Doctors per 1,000 People  
- Testing Rate  
- Region  
- Risk Score  
- Risk Level  

### Risk Classification

Each data record is assigned a risk score and categorized into one of the following levels:

- Low Risk  
- Medium Risk  
- High Risk  

---

## Visualizations

The project produces several visual outputs, including:

- Risk level distribution chart  
- Regional disease hotspot analysis  
- Correlation heatmap of major attributes  

These visualizations help reveal patterns, correlations, and high-risk regions within the dataset.

## Intended Use

This project is suitable for:

- Academic coursework and learning  
- Data analysis and visualization practice  
- Public health and epidemiology simulations  
- Experimentation with risk modeling techniques
